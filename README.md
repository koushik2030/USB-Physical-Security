The "USB Physical Security Application" is an advanced desktop application developed using
Tkinter, designed to enhance security by managing USB port access on Windows operating
systems. This application provides a robust mechanism for controlling USB ports through secure
email-based authentication. Users can register their Gmail addresses, which are then hashed and
stored for verification purposes. The application also features a local server component that delivers
supplementary project information through a web interface. Additionally, it incorporates email
functionality for secure password generation and distribution, ensuring a seamless user experience
while maintaining high-security standards.
